# Pinky

This library is named after Pinky from Pinky and the Brain.
It is a neural network library which allows to build fully connected layers.

## 3D shapes + convolutions

3D shapes are read in in such a way that the same pixel in different channels (e.g. colors)
are close together. After the first convolution, however, the channels are separated and
are no longer close together.
